# Using github to store and submit your homework


It would be great if you got used to using Github and git to save your work, which lets you work backwards whenever there's a problem and allows for collaboration. But some people don't want to do that, which is fine. 

The only caveat is that it's possible for things to get mis-matched if you combine these two methods, so pick one and stick with it. If you change your mind. 

## One-time setup

Use the "Use this template" button above to create a shell , or repo, for your homework. It will copy the basic structure and these instructions to your account. It's ok to leave the name of the repo alone -- they're specific to users, not to Github as a whole, so it doesn't matter. 

## Getting your assignment

When you open the link from homework, there will be a button on the screen that says "Raw". Right-click on that button and choose Save File As..., and navigate to the appropriate folder on your computer --- the one that has the RStudio project that we're working on. I may need you to download some files, but that will be rare -- most of them will be hosted remotely and you don't have to copy them. 

## Submitting your work 

You should add your name to the name of the file when you save your work. This can be done either on your computer or here on Github. But you'll have to rename it. 

### Method 1: Preferred way

The preferred method is to use Github on your computer to push, pull and update your work. 

### Method 2: The web way


If you're uncomfortable with Github Desktop and the whole idea of version control, you don't have to use it. Instead, you can just use the Web interface from Github to get and store your homework.
